    <introduction>
        <p>In earlier sections, we learned how to multiply polynomials, such as when you start with <m>(x+2)(x+3)</m> and obtain <m>x^2+5x+6</m>. This chapter, starting with this section, is about the <em>opposite</em> process<mdash/>factoring. For example, starting with <m>x^2+5x+6</m> and obtaining <m>(x+2)(x+3)</m>. The factoring in this first section is a little less involved: for example starting with <m>x^2+2x</m> and obtaining <m>x(x+2)</m>.</p>

    <subsection>
        <title>Motivation for Factoring</title>

        <p>When you write <m>x^2+2x</m>, you have a mathematical expression built with two terms<mdash/>two parts that are <em>added</em> together. When you write <m>x(x+2)</m>, you have a mathematical expression built with two factors<mdash/>two parts that are <em>multiplied</em> together. Factoring is useful, because sometimes (but not always) having your expression written as parts that are <em>multiplied</em> together makes it easy to simplify the expression.</p>

        <p>You've seen this with fractions. To simplify <m>\frac{15}{35}</m>, breaking down the numerator and denominator into factors is useful: <m>\frac{3\cdot5}{7\cdot5}</m>. Now you can see that the factors of <m>5</m> cancel. But if you had started with the numerator and denominator broken into additive parts like <m>\frac{7+8}{22+13}</m>, that's just not helpful to simplify the fraction.</p>

        <p>There are a few other reasons to appreciate the value of factoring that will float to the surface in this chapter and beyond.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
        <title>Identifying the Greatest Common Factor</title>

        <p>The most basic technique for factoring involves recognizing the <term>greatest common factor</term> between two expressions. For example, the greatest common factor between <m>6</m> and <m>8</m> is <m>2</m>. If you fully factor <m>6</m>, you have <m>2\cdot3</m>. And if you fully factor <m>8</m>, you have <m>2\cdot2\cdot2</m>. The only factor they have in common is <m>2</m>, so that is the greatest common factor.</p>

        <p>Similarly, the greatest common factor between <m>2x</m> and <m>3x^2</m> is <m>x</m>. If you fully factor <m>2x</m>, you have <m>2\cdot x</m>. And if you fully factor <m>3x^2</m>, you have <m>3\cdot x\cdot x</m>.  The only factor they have in common is <m>x</m>, so that is the greatest common factor.</p>

        <p>In these previous examples, one of the factors themselves ended up being the greatest common factor. This is not always the case.</p>

        <example>
            <title>Finding the Greatest Common Factor</title>
            <p>What is the common factor between <m>6x^2</m> and <m>70x</m>? Break down each of these into its factors:<md>
                <mrow>6x^2 \amp =2\cdot3\cdot x\cdot x \amp 70x \amp =2\cdot5\cdot7\cdot x</mrow>
                <intertext>and identify the common factors</intertext>
                <mrow>6x^2 \amp =\attention{2}\cdot3\cdot \attention{x}\cdot x \amp 70x \amp =\attention{2}\cdot5\cdot7\cdot \attention{x}</mrow>
            </md>With <m>2</m> and <m>x</m> in common, the greatest common factor is <m>2x</m>.</p>
        </example>

        <p>Let's try a few more examples.</p>

        <title>Factoring Out the Greatest Common Factor</title>

        <p>We have learned the Distributive Property: <m>a(b+c)=ab+ac</m>. Perhaps you have thought of this as a way to <q>distribute</q> the number <m>a</m> to each of <m>b</m> and <m>c</m>. In this section, we will use the Distributive Property in the opposite way. If you have an expression <m>ab+ac</m>, it is equal to <m>a(b+c)</m>. In that example, we factored out <m>a</m>, which is the common factor between <m>ab</m> and <m>ac</m>.</p>

        <p>The following steps use the Distributive Property to factor out the greatest common factor between two or more terms.</p>

                    <p>Note that you might fail to recognize that <m>3x</m> is the greatest common factor. At first you might only find that, say, <m>3</m> is a common factor. This is OK<mdash/>you can factor out the <m>3</m> and continue from there:<md>

                    </md>Now examine the second factor here and there is <em>still</em> a common factor. Factoring this out too yields:<md>
                        <mrow>3x^3+3x^2-9x\amp=3x(\phantom{x^2+x-3})</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=3x(x^2\phantom{{}+x-3})</mrow>

        <p>Here is an alternative for factoring out the greatest common factor. This technique is more visual, and may help students having trouble with the <q>filling in the blank</q> technique.</p>

        <p>In <xref ref="section-multiplying-polynomials">Section</xref>, we learned one way to multiply polynomials using rectangle diagrams. Similarly, we can factor a polynomial with a rectangle diagram.</p>

        <title>More Examples of Factoring out the Common Factor</title>

        <p>The previous subsection did not have examples that cover every nuance with factoring out the greatest common factor. Here are a few more factoring examples that attempt to do so.</p>

        <example>
            <p>Factor <m>-35m^5+5m^4-10m^3</m>.</p>

            <p>First, we identify the common factor. Instead of literally factoring each term as we did in earlier examples, it may help to recognize that <m>5</m> is the greatest common factor of the three coefficients (which were <m>-35</m>, <m>5</m>, and <m>-10</m>). And also to recognize that the largest power of <m>m</m> that divides all three terms is <m>m^3</m>. Therefore the greatest common factor is <m>5m^3</m>.</p>

            <p>However, the leading term in this example is a negative number. When this happens, it is usually wise to take that negative as part of the greatest common factor. So we will proceed by factoring out <m>-5m^3</m>.<md>
                <mrow>-35m^5+5m^4-10m^3\amp=-5m^3(\phantom{7m^2-m+2})</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=-5m^3(7m^2\phantom{{}-m+2})</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=-5m^3(7m^2-m\phantom{{}+2})</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=-5m^3(7m^2-m+2)</mrow>
            </md></p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>Factor <m>14-7n^2+28n^4-21n</m>.</p>

            <p>Notice that the terms are not in a standard order where the powers of <m>n</m> are smaller as you read left to right. Factoring in general may involve more than dealing with the greatest common factor as we are doing in this section. The complications that arise (and will be discussed in later sections) make it wise for us to rearrange the terms into the standard order first:<me>14-7n^2+28n^4-21n=28n^4-7n^2-21n+14</me>.</p>

            <p>Next, we identify the common factor. The number <m>7</m> divides all of the numerical coefficients. Owing to the <m>-7n^2</m> term, there is no larger numerical factor to consider. Separately, no power of <m>n</m> is part of the greatest common factor because no power of <m>n</m> divides into the <m>14</m> term. So the greatest common factor is just <m>7</m>. So we proceed:<md>
                <mrow>14-7n^2+28n^4-21n\amp=28n^4-7n^2-21n+14</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=7(\phantom{4n^4-n^2-3n+2})</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=7(4n^4\phantom{{}-n^2-3n+2})</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=7(4n^4-n^2\phantom{{}-3n+2})</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=7(4n^4-n^2-3n\phantom{{}+2})</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp=7(4n^4-n^2-3n+2)</mrow>
            </md></p>
        </example>
        
        <example>
            <p>Factor <m>4m^2n-3xy</m>.</p>

            <p>There are no common factors in those two terms (unless you want to count <m>1</m> or <m>-1</m>, but we do not count these for the purposes of identifying a greatest common factor). In this situation we can say the polynomial is <term>prime</term> or <term>irreducible</term>, and leave it as it is.</p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>Factor <m>-x^3+2x+18</m>.</p>

            <p>There are no common factors in those three terms, and it would be correct to state that this polynomial is prime or irreducible. However, since its leading coefficient is negative, it may be wise to factor out the negation. So alternatively, it could be factored as <m>-\left(x^3-2x-18\right)</m>. Note that <em>every</em> term is negated as the leading negative sign is extracted.</p>

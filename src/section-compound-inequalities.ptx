    <title>Compound Inequalities</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>On the newest version of the SAT (an exam that often qualifies students for colleges) the minimum score that you can earn is <m>400</m> and the maximum score that you can earn is <m>1600</m>. This means that only numbers between <m>400</m> and <m>1600</m>, including these endpoints, are possible scores. To plot all of these values on a number line would look something like this<ellipsis/></p>

        <p>Going back to the original statement, <q>the minimum score that you can earn is <m>400</m> and the maximum score that you can earn is <m>1600</m></q>, this really says two things. First, it says that <m>(\text{an SAT score})\geq400</m>, and, second, that <m>(\text{an SAT score})\leq1600</m>. When we combine two inequalities like this into a single problem, it becomes a <term>compound inequality</term>. Before you go on, if you would like a refresher on solving linear inequalities, read <xref ref="section-solving-multistep-linear-equations-and-inequalities" text="title">the section on solving linear inequalities</xref>.</p>

        <p>Our lives are often constrained by the compound inequalities of reality: you need to buy enough materials to complete your project, but you can only fit so much into your vehicle; you would like to finish your degree early, but only have so much money and time to put toward your courses; you would like a vegetable garden big enough to supply you with veggies all summer long, but your yard or balcony only gets so much sun<ellipsis/> In the rest of the section we will hope to illuminate how to think mathematically about problems like these.</p>

                <p>The <term>union</term><idx><h>union</h></idx> of two sets, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, is the set of all elements contained in either <m>A</m> <term>or</term> <m>B</m>, or both. We write <m>A\cup B</m> to indicate the union of the two sets.</p>
                <p>In other words, the union of two sets is what you get if you toss every number in both sets into a bigger set.</p>
            </statement>
        </definition>

        <example>
            <p>The union of sets <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m> and <m>\{3,4,5,6\}</m> is the set of all elements in either set (or both). So <m>\{\highlight{1,2,3,4}\}\cup\{3,4,\highlight{5,6}\}=\{\highlight{1,2,3,4,5,6}\}</m>. Note that we don't write duplicates.</p>

        <example>
            <p>The intersection of sets <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m> and <m>\{3,4,5,6\}</m> is the set of all elements that are in common to both sets. So <m>\{1,2,\highlight{3,4}\}\cap\{\highlight{3,4},5,6\}=\{\highlight{3,4}\}</m>.</p>

                <p>Recall that the union of two sets is the set of the combination of numbers from both sets. Looking at the graph, we need to include all of the numbers from both colored lines. Imagine pressing these two colored lines together as if they were long strands of modeling clay. The new combined strand would go from <m>-3</m> all the way to <m>8</m>. Note that <m>-3</m> would be included on this new line because it was in <m>[-3,5)</m>, but <m>8</m> wouldn't be on this new line because it wasn't on either of the lines.</p>

Note that the number <m>2</m> is in both sets, but since <m>5</m> is not in the set <m>[-3,5)</m>, we should exclude <m>5</m> from the intersection.

        <remark><p>Note that every intersection of two intervals can and should be simplified in some way. Even if the sets have nothing in common at all, as in <m>(-\infty,1]</m> and <m>[5,\infty)</m>, their intersection can be written as <m>(-\infty,1]\cap[5,\infty)=\emptyset</m>. On the other hand, there <em>are</em> some unions which cannot be algebraically simplified. For example, if the two sets have nothing in common, as in <m>(-\infty,1]</m> and <m>[5,\infty)</m> again, then the union is simply <m>(-\infty,1]\cup[5,\infty)</m> which is our final simplification.</p></remark>

            <notation>
                <usage>compound inequality</usage>
                <description>Viewing two separate inequalities as a single larger inequality with pieces.</description>
            </notation>
            <statement>
                <p>A <term>compound inequality</term><idx><h>compound inequality</h></idx> is a grouping of two or more inequalities into a larger inequality statement. These usually come in two flavors: <q>or</q> and <q>and</q> inequalities.</p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>In math, the technical term <term>or</term> means <q>either or both</q>. So, mathematically, if we asked if you would like <q>chocolate cake <em>or</em> apple pie</q> for dessert, your choices are either <q>chocolate cake</q>, <q>apple pie</q>, or <q>both chocolate cake and apple pie</q>. This is slightly different than the English <q>or</q> which usually means <q>one or the other but not both</q>.</p>
        <p><q>Or</q> shows up in math between equations (as in when solving a quadratic equation, you might end up with <q><m>x=2</m> or <m>x=-3</m></q>) or between inequalities (which is what we're about to discuss).</p>
        <remark><p>The definition of <q>or</q> is very close to the definition of a union where you combine elements from either or both sets together. In fact, when you have an <q>or</q> between inequalities in a compound inequality, to find the solution set of the compound inequality, you find the union of the the solutions sets of each of the pieces.</p></remark>
        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>Solve the compound inequality <me>x\lt4\quad\text{or}\quad x\leq1</me>.</p>

        <title><q>And</q> Compound Inequalities</title>
        <p>The inequality <m>1\leq 2\lt 3</m> says a lot more than you might think. It actually says four different single inequalities which are highlighted for you to see.</p>
        <p><ol label="a.">
            <li><m>\highlight{1}\mathbin{\highlight{\leq}}\highlight{2}\mathbin{\lowlight{\lt}}\lowlight{3}</m></li>
            <li><m>\highlight{1}\mathbin{\highlight{\leq}}\lowlight{2}\mathbin{\lowlight{\lt}}\highlight{3}</m></li>
            <li><m>\highlight{1}\mathbin{\lowlight{\leq}}\lowlight{2}\mathbin{\highlight{\lt}}\highlight{3}</m></li>
            <li><m>\lowlight{1}\mathbin{\lowlight{\leq}}\highlight{2}\mathbin{\highlight{\lt}}\highlight{3}</m></li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>This might seem trivial at first, but if you are presented with an inequality like <m>-1\lt3\geq2</m>, at first it might look sensible; however, in reality, you need to check that <em>all four</em> linear inequalities make sense. Those are highlighted here.</p>
        <p><ol label="a.">
            <li><m>\highlight{-1}\mathbin{\highlight{\lt}}\highlight{3}\mathbin{\lowlight{\geq}}\lowlight{2}</m></li>
            <li><m>\highlight{-1}\mathbin{\highlight{\lt}}\lowlight{3}\mathbin{\lowlight{\geq}}\highlight{2}</m></li>
            <li xml:id="item-false-inequality"><m>\highlight{-1}\mathbin{\lowlight{\lt}}\lowlight{3}\mathbin{\highlight{\geq}}\highlight{2}</m></li>
            <li><m>\lowlight{-1}\mathbin{\lowlight{\lt}}\highlight{3}\mathbin{\highlight{\geq}}\highlight{2}</m></li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>One of these inequalities is false! <xref ref="item-false-inequality">Item</xref>: <m>-1\ngeq2</m>. This implies that the entire original inequality, <m>-1\lt3\geq2</m>, is nonsense.</p>

        </example>

        <p>As a general hint, no (nontrivial) three part inequality can ever be true if the inequality signs are not pointing in the same direction. So no matter what numbers <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are, both <m>a\lt b\geq c</m> and <m>a\geq b \lt c</m> cannot be true! Soon you will be writing inequalities like <m>2\lt x \leq 4</m> and you need to be sure to check that your answer is feasible. You will know that if you get <m>2\gt x \leq 4</m> or <m>2\lt x \geq 4</m> that something went wrong in the solving process. The only exception is that something like <m>1\leq1\geq1</m> is true because <m>1=1=1</m>, although this shouldn't come up very often!</p>

        <p>Next, there are two different kinds of <q>and</q> compound inequalities. One type has two inequalities joined by the word <q>and</q>, like <me>A \lt B \quad\text{and} \quad C\geq D</me>. The other type has an expression that is <q>between</q> two values, as we have been discussing in the past examples, like <me>A \lt B \leq C</me>.</p>

        <remark xml:id="remark-triple-inequality"><p>The inequality <q><m>A \lt B \leq C</m></q> is equivalent to <q><m>A \lt B</m> and <m>B\leq C</m>,</q> but we don't need to break it up into the two statements. It can also be read as <q>B is between A and C.</q></p></remark>

        <remark><p>An <q>and</q> statement means that you need both inequalities to be true simultaneously. In English, if you say, <q>I need Khaleem <em>and</em> Freja to paint the fence,</q> then the only way you will be happy is if <em>both</em> people are working simultaneously on the fence. This statement that both things happen at the same time should be very reminiscent of our discussion of intersections earlier in this section. In fact, every <q>and</q> statement will result in the intersection of the solution sets of the pieces.</p></remark>

                <p>Recall that an <q>and</q> problem finds the intersection of the solution sets. Intersection finds the <m>t</m>-values where the two lines overlap, so the solution to the compound inequality must be <me>(-\infty,3)\cap[-1,\infty)=[-1,3)</me>.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Last, we should choose a number that is not a solution that is on the <q>other side</q> of the solution set. We will arbitrarily choose <m>\highlight{-2}</m>.<md>

                </ul></p>
                <p>So, numbers outside the proposed solution region make the compound inequality false, and numbers inside the region make the compound inequality true. We have verified our solution set.</p>

                <p>To solve the inequality <m>2\leq f(x) \lt 6</m> means to find the <m>x</m>-values that give function values between <m>2</m> and <m>6</m>, not including <m>6</m>. We draw a solid horizontal line for <m>y=2</m> and a dotted line for <m>y=6</m>. Then we look for the points of intersection and find their <m>x</m>-values.

        <title>Solving Compound Inequalities Graphically</title>
        <p>So far we have focused on solving inequalities algebraically. Next, we will describe how to solve compound inequalities graphically. As an initial hint, if you are solving where line <m>1</m> is less or equal to line <m>2</m>, the first step is always to identify where (as in <m>x</m>-values) those two lines cross. After that, you need to decide if the inequality is true on the left or on the right of that intersection.</p>

        <title>Applications of Compound inequalities</title>
        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>Raphael's friend is getting married and he's decided to give them some dishes from their registry. Raphael doesn't want to seem cheap but isn't a wealthy man either, so he wants to buy <q>enough</q> but not <q>too many</q>. He's decided that he definitely wants to spend at least <m>\$150</m> on his friend, but less than <m>\$250</m>. Each dish is <m>\$21.70</m> and shipping on an order of any size is going to be <m>\$19.99</m>. Given his budget, set up and algebraically solve a compound inequality to find out what his different options are for the number of dishes that he can buy.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>First, we should define our variable. Let <m>x</m> represent the number of dishes that Raphael can buy. Next we should write a compound inequality that describes this situation. In this case, Raphael wants to spend between <m>\$150</m> and <m>\$250</m> and, since he's buying <m>x</m> dishes, the price that he will pay is <m>21.70x+19.99</m>. All of this translates to a triple inequality <me>150 \lt 21.70x+19.99 \lt 250</me></p>
                <p>Now we have to solve this inequality in the usual way.<md>
                    <mrow>150 \amp\lt 21.70x+19.99 \lt 250</mrow>
                    <mrow>150\subtractright{19.99} \amp\lt 21.70x+19.99\subtractright{19.99} \lt 250\subtractright{19.99}</mrow>
                    <mrow>130.01 \amp\lt 21.70x \lt 230.01</mrow>
                    <mrow>\divideunder{130.01}{21.70} \amp\lt \divideunder{21.70x}{21.70} \lt \divideunder{230.01}{21.70}</mrow>
                    <mrow>5.991 \amp\lt x \lt 10.6</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp\text{\{note: these values are approximate\}}</mrow>
                </md></p>
                <p>The interpretation of this inequality is a little tricky. Remember that <m>x</m> represents the number of dishes Raphael can afford. Since you cannot buy <m>5.991</m> dishes (manufacturers will typically only ship whole number amounts of tableware) his minimum purchase must be <m>6</m> dishes. We have a similar problem with his maximum purchase: clearly he cannot buy <m>10.6</m> dishes. So, should we round up or down? If we rounded up, that would be <m>11</m> dishes and that would cost <m>\$21.70\cdot\highlight{11}+\$19.99=\$258.69</m>, which is outside his price range. Therefore, we should actually round <em>down</em> in this case.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, Raphael should buy somewhere between 6 and 10 dishes for his friend to stay within his budget.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a renowned scientific research facility, compiled some <url href="http://cta.ornl.gov/data/chapter4.shtml">data in table 4.28</url><fn><url href="http://cta.ornl.gov/data/chapter4.shtml">cta.ornl.gov/data/chapter4.shtml</url></fn> on fuel efficiency of a mid-size hybrid car versus the speed that the car was driven. A model for the fuel efficiency <m>e(x)</m> (in miles per gallon, <quantity><unit base="milepergallon"/></quantity>) at a speed <m>x</m> (in miles per hour, <quantity><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity>) is <m>e(x)=88-0.7x</m>.</p>

                <p><ol>
                    <li><p>Evaluate and interpret <m>e(60)</m> in the context of the problem.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Note that this model only applies between certain speeds. The maximum fuel efficiency for which this formula applies is <quantity><mag>55</mag><unit base="milepergallon"/></quantity> and the minimum fuel efficiency for which it applies is <quantity><mag>33</mag><unit base="milepergallon"/></quantity>. Set up and algebraically solve a compound inequality to find the range of speeds for which this model applies.</p></li>
                </ol></p>

            <solution>
                <p><ol>
                    <li><p>Let's evaluate <m>e(60)</m> first.<md>

                        </md></p>
                        <p>So, when the hybrid car travels at a speed of <quantity><mag>60</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity>, it has a fuel efficiency of <quantity><mag>46</mag><unit base="milepergallon"/></quantity>.</p></li>
                    <li><p>In this case, the minimum efficiency is <quantity><mag>33</mag><unit base="milepergallon"/></quantity> and the maximum efficiency is <quantity><mag>55</mag><unit base="milepergallon"/></quantity>. We need to trap our formula between these two values to solve for the respective speeds.<md>

                <p>This inequality says that our model is applicable when the car's speed is between about <quantity><mag>47</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity> and about <quantity><mag>79</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/></quantity>.</p>

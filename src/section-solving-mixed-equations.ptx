  <title>Solving Mixed Equations</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we will learn techniques to differentiate between different types of equations and recall the various methods used to solve them. Real life doesn't come with instructions, so it is important to develop the skills in this section. One day, you might be faced with a geometry problem in your home, or a rational equation in a lab and it will be your responsibility to make the right choice of how to tackle the situation!
    </p>
    <p>
      We have solved a variety of equations in ORCCA and we have already covered a section on <xref ref="section-solving-equations-in-general" text="title"></xref>. Since then, we have covered even more topics, so it seems time to refresh ourselves on everything that we have done so far. Here is a reference guide to all of the sections that cover solving equations. We hope that this section will help pinpoint those that you need help with.

  <subsection>
    <title>Types of Equations</title>
    <p>
      The point of this section isn't to compartmentalize your knowledge to help learn small pieces, it's to put all the pieces that we've learned previously together and how to differentiate those pieces from one another. To do that, we need to recall the different types of equations that we have had before.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <xref ref="definition-linear-equation-and-inequality" text="title">Linear Equation</xref>: this is a type of equation where the variable that we are solving for is to the first power. Examples are <m>7(x-2)=\frac{3}{5}x+1</m> and <m>rt=4t+3r-1</m> where <m>r</m> is the variable and <m>t</m> is considered a constant. The <xref ref="list-solve-multistep-linear-equation" text="title"></xref> are quite concrete.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <xref ref="definition-system-of-linear-equations" text="title"></xref>: this is a grouping of two linear equations. An example is
                    <me permid="RWW">
                        \left\{
                        \begin{alignedat}{3}
                        y \amp {}={} \amp 3x \amp {}+{} \amp 1 \\
                        y \amp {}={} \amp 2x \amp {}-{} \amp 5
                        \end{alignedat}
                        \right.
                    </me>
                    One can use either
                    <xref ref="algorithm-solving-systems-of-equations-by-substitution" text="title">substitution</xref> or
                    <xref ref="algorithm-solving-systems-of-equations-by-elimination" text="title">elimination</xref> to solve these systems.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <xref ref="definition-quadratic-equation" text="title"></xref>: this is a type of equation where the variable being solved for is squared at some point in the equation (but where there are no higher powers of the variable). Examples are <m>3x^2+2x-4=0</m> and <m>6(y-2)^2-1=7</m>. There are several methods to solve quadratic equations including using
                    <xref ref="fact-square-root-property" text="title">the square root method</xref>,
                    <xref ref="fact-the-quadratic-formula" text="title">the quadratic formula</xref>,
                    <xref ref="algorithm-solving-quadratic-equations-by-factoring" text="title">factoring</xref>,
                    and <xref ref="algorithm-completing-the-square" text="title">completing the square</xref>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <xref ref="definition-radical-equation" text="title"></xref>: this is a type of equation where the variable is inside a root of some kind. We usually <xref ref="algorithm-solving-radical-equations" text="title">solve radical equations</xref> by isolating the radical and raising both sides to a power to cancel the radical.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <xref ref="definition-rational-equation" text="title"></xref>: this is a type of equation where the variable is in the denominator. Solving these equations involves <xref ref="algorithm-solving-rational-equations" text="title">canceling the denominator</xref> and solving the equation that remains.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <remark>
        <p>
            Note that for all of these equations, we will be assuming that they are equations in one variable, i.e. that the solution will be a number or expression rather than a set of points. For example, the equation <m>3=2x+5</m> has a single solution, <m>-1</m>, whereas the equation <m>y=2x+5</m> has infinitely many solutions, all points, that make up the line with slope <m>2</m> and vertical intercept <m>(0,5)</m>.

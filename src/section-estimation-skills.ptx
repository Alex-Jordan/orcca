  <!-- <introduction>
    <p>
      Estimation is a valuable mathematical skill used in many scenarios.
      It can be used with all types of numbers and graphs.
      Knowing some estimation strategies allows you to make quick reasonable calculations,
      interpret data from graphs and tables, and check the reasonableness of solutions.
    </p>

    <title>Benchmarks</title>

    <p>
      One useful tool for all types of estimation is what is referred to as <term>benchmarks</term>.
      When using benchmarks, you are rounding numbers to create numbers that are easy to calculate with in your head.
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        There is a 25% off sale for all winter clothing at a local store.
        You are interested in a sweater that originally sells for $42.99.
        What are some different ways you could quickly estimate what the sale price will be?
      </p>

      <p>
        The sale is by 25%, which is the same as the fraction <m>\frac{1}{4}</m>.
        It would be easy to calculate the sale price in your head if only the original price were not as decimal-rich as $42.99.
        We can <q>round</q> that amount to something like $44, which is easy to cut in fourths.
        If we do that, then the discount is <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> of $44, which is $11.
        And so the sale price would be $33. Except that is a little bit off because we rounded.
        We've <em>estimated</em> the sale price to be $33.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alternatively we could have rounded the original price to $40,
        and from there we estimate that the sale price will be $10 less,
        at $30.
      </p>

      <p>
        A different approach is to just round the original price to $43.
        It may be hard to find 25% of this, but it's not so hard to find 10%.
        With 10%, we only need to divide by <m>10</m>, so 10% of $43 is $4.30.
        Subtract another 10%, and you've subtracted $8.60.
        Then 5% is half of 10%, so 5% of $43 is half of $4.30, which is $2.15.
        To subtract the full 25%, subtract 10%, another 10%, and then 5%.
        So we subtract $4.30, another $4.30, and then $2.15.
        That comes to $10.75.
        So we estimate the final price to be $10.75 less than $43, which is $32.25.
      </p>
    </example>
  </subsection> -->


<!-- Benchmarks that make percent problems easy to estimate and think about are generally 10%, 25%,
 33 1/3%, and 50%.  With 10%, you can quickly estimate 1%, 5%, 15%, and any multiple of 10%.
Example:  You have a cash back credit card that awards 1% cash back every time you pay your bill.  If your bill for the month of June is $279, about how much will your cash back award be?
  Round to 280, take 1% then multiply by 2

I think we could have visual estimation (ruler for fractions and decimals, bar graph for large numbers, pie charts for percents) as well as word problems where students estimate to find approximate answers as well as problems where they estimate to check their answers for reasonableness.  I'm wondering about a small intro for each type with example. -->

    <title>Setting Up Equations for Geometry Problems</title>
    <p permid="laT">
      With geometry problems and algebra,
      there is often the possibility to draw some picture to help understand the scenario better.
      Additionally it is often necessary to rely on some formula from geometry,
      such as the formulas from <xref ref="subsection-perimeter-and-area">Subsection</xref>.
    </p>

    <example permid="cTE">
      <statement>
        <p permid="Snv">
          An Olympic-size swimming pool is rectangular and
          <quantity>
            <mag>50</mag><unit base="meter" />
          </quantity>
          in length.
          We don't know its width, but we do know that it required
          <quantity>
            <mag>150</mag><unit base="meter" />
          </quantity>
          of painter's tape to outline the edge of the pool during recent renovations.
          Use this information to set up an equation that models the width of the pool.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="sqX">
        <sidebyside widths="59% 35%" margins="0%" permid="JaN">
          <p permid="YcH">
            Since the pool's shape is a rectangle,
            it helps to sketch a rectangle representing the pool as in <xref ref="figure-olympic-pool">Figure</xref>.
            Since we know its length is
            <quantity>
              <mag>50</mag><unit base="meter" />
            </quantity>, it is a good idea to label that in the sketch.
            The width is our unknown quantity,
            so we can use <m>w</m> as a variable to represent the pool's width in meters and label that too.
          </p>

          <figure xml:id="figure-olympic-pool" permid="Qyi">
            <caption>An Olympic-size pool</caption>
            <image permid="flH">

            <latex-image>
                \begin{tikzpicture}[x=1mm,y=1mm]
                    \draw[fill=blue!60!green!40!white] (0,0) rectangle (50,25);
                    \node[below] at (25,0) {$50$};
                    \node[right] at (50,12.5) {$w$};
                \end{tikzpicture}
            </latex-image>
            </image>

          </figure>

        <p permid="EjQ">
          Since it required
          <quantity>
            <mag>150</mag><unit base="meter" />
          </quantity>
          of painter's tape to outline the pool,
          we know the perimeter of the pool is
          <quantity>
            <mag>150</mag><unit base="meter" />
          </quantity>.
          This suggests using the perimeter formula for a rectangle:
          <m>P=2(\ell+w)</m>. (This formula was discussed in <xref ref="subsection-perimeter-and-area">Subsection</xref>).
        </p>

        <p permid="kqZ">
          With this formula,
          we can substitute <m>150</m> in for <m>P</m> and <m>50</m> in for <m>\ell</m>:
          <me permid="GIX">
            150=2(50+w)
          </me>
          and this equation models the width of the pool.
        </p>

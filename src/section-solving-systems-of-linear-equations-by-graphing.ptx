            <p>Amy and d'Marie are running at constant speeds on a track. Amy starts out ahead of d'Marie, but d'Marie is running faster. We want to determine when d'Marie will catch up with Amy. Let's start by looking at the graph of each runner's distance over time:</p>

            <p>As we can see in <xref ref="figure-solving-systems-by-graphing-intro">Figure</xref>, the graphs of the two equations cross at the point <m>(6,12)</m>. This tells us that after <m>6</m> seconds, each runner has traveled the same distance, <m>12</m> meters.
            </p>

            <p>The two lines above are called a <term>system of linear equations</term>. We refer to the point <m>(6,12)</m> as the <term>solution</term> to this system of linear equations. To denote the solution set, we write <m>\{(6,12)\}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>If we want to write this system of linear equations algebraically, we would first determine the equation for each line. Letting <m>y</m> be the distance in meters after <m>t</m> seconds, we denote Amy's line with <m>y=\frac{4}{3}t+4</m> and d'Marie's line with <m>y=2t</m>. To show that we are working with a system of two equations, we write:

        </example>

        <remark><p>
            In <xref ref="example-solving-systems-by-graphing-intro">Example</xref>, we stated that the solution was the point <m>(6,12)</m>. It makes sense to list this solution as an ordered pair when we're given the graph. In some cases, particularly when our variables are not <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> and we are not given a graph, we won't be able to determine an ordered pair (as the order is unknown). In this case, we would write the solution as <m>t=6</m> and <m>y=12</m> instead.

The second equation, <m>y=-x-5</m>, is a linear equation with a slope of <m>-1</m> and a <m>y</m>-intercept of <m>(0,-5)</m>. We'll use this to graph each line:

            </solution>
        </example>


        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>Solve the following system of equations by graphing:<md>
                    <mrow>

                    </mrow></md></p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>Since both lines are given in standard form, we'll graph them by using the intercept method. Recall that to find the <m>x</m>-intercept of each equation, we'll replace <m>y</m> with <m>0</m> and solve for <m>x</m>. Similarly, to find the <m>y</m>-intercept of each equation, we'll replace <m>x</m> with <m>0</m> and solve for <m>y</m>.</p>

                <p>For our first equation, we get:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>x-3(\substitute{0}) \amp= -12 </mrow>
                        <mrow>x \amp= -12 </mrow>
                    </md>
                    and 
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\substitute{0}-3y \amp=-12</mrow>
                        <mrow>-3y \amp= -12 </mrow>
                        <mrow>y\amp= 4</mrow>
                    </md>
                    So the <m>x</m>-intercept is <m>(-12,0)</m> and the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,4)</m>. 
                </p>

                <p>For our second equation, we get:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>2x+3(\substitute{0}) \amp= 3</mrow>
                        <mrow>2x \amp= 3</mrow>
                        <mrow>x \amp= \frac{3}{2}</mrow>
                    </md>
                    and 
                    <md>
                        <mrow>2(\substitute{0})+3y \amp= 3 </mrow>
                        <mrow>3y \amp= 3 </mrow>
                        <mrow>y\amp= 1</mrow>
                    </md>
                    So the <m>x</m>-intercept is <m>\left(\frac{3}{2},0\right)</m> and the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,1)</m>. 
                </p>

                <p>Now we will graph each line by plotting the intercepts and connecting these points:</p>

        <title>Special Systems of Equations</title>

        <p>Recall that when we solved linear equations in one variable, we had two special cases. In one special case there was no solution and in the other case, there were infinitely many solutions. When solving systems of equations in two variables, we have two similar special cases.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-solving-systems-by-graphing-parallel-lines">
            <p>Let's look at the graphs of two lines with the same slope, <m>y=2x-4</m> and <m>y=2x+1</m>:</p>

            <p>For this system of equations, what is the solution? We know that since the two lines have the same slope (and are thus parallel) they will never intersect. This means that there is <em>no solution</em> to this system of equations. We write the solution set as <m>\emptyset</m>.</p>
        </example>

        <example xml:id="example-solving-systems-by-graphing-equivalent-equations">
            <p>Next we'll look at the other special case. Let's start with this system of equations:
                <md>
                    <mrow>
                    \left\{

                        6x-3y \amp {}={} \amp 12 \\

                </md>
            To solve this system of equations by graphing, we want to graph each line. The first equation, <m>y=2x-4</m> is in slope-intercept form and can be graphed using its <m>y</m>-intercept of <m>(0,-4)</m> and slope of <m>2</m>. The second equation, <m>6x-3y=12</m>, can either be graphed by solving for <m>y</m> and usine the slope intercept form or by using the intercept method. If we use the intercept method, we'll find that this line has an <m>x</m>-intercept of <m>(2,0)</m> and a <m>y</m>-intercept of <m>(0,-4)</m>. Let's graph each of these lines now:</p>

            <p>As we can see these were actually the <em>same</em> line. To determine the solution to this system, we'll note that they overlap everywhere on each line. This means that we have an infinite number of solutions: all points that fall on each line. To write this solution set, we need to write a set representing all points on the line. We can do so like this: <m>\{(x,y)\mid y=2x-4\}</m>.

            What would have happened if we had instead decided to solve <m>6x-3y=12</m> for <m>y</m> in 
            <xref ref="example-solving-systems-by-graphing-equivalent-equations">Example</xref>? Doing so, we get this:

                </md>
            As we can see, this is the exact same equation as the other equation in our system. This shows that these two equations are equivalent equations. Any time we try to solve a system of equations where the equations are equivalent, we'll have an infinite set of solutions.
        </p></remark>


        <p>Let's summarize the possible solutions we can have to a system of linear equations:
            <dl>
                <li><title>Parallel Lines:</title><p>If two linear equations in a system have the same slope with different <m>y</m>-intercepts, the system has no solution.</p></li>
                <li><title>Overlapping Lines:</title><p>If two linear equations in a system have the same slope and the same <m>y</m>-intercept (in other words, they are equivalent equations), the system has infinitely many solutions. This solution set consists of all ordered pairs on that line.</p></li>
                <li><title>Intersecting Lines:</title><p>If two linear equations in a system have different slopes, the system has one solution.</p></li>
            </dl>
        </p>

        <warning><p>
            Notice that for a system of equations with infinite solutions like <xref ref="example-solving-systems-by-graphing-equivalent-equations">Example</xref>, we didn't say that <em>every</em> point was a solution. Rather, every point that falls on that line is a solution. It would be incorrect to state this solution set as <q>all real numbers</q> or as <q>all ordered pairs.</q>

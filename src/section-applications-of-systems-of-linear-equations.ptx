    <title>Applications of Systems of Linear Equations</title>

    <introduction><p><xref ref="example-system-of-equations-elimination-intro">Example</xref> below is an example of how a system of linear equations can be used to solve an application problem. In this section, we will look at several types of application problems that can be solved using a system of linear equations, while giving you some strategies for solving these problems.</p></introduction>

    <example xml:id="example-system-of-equations-elimination-intro">
            <p>Alicia has <m>\$1000</m> to give to her two grandchildren for New Year's. She would like to give the older grandchild <m>\$120</m> more than the younger grandchild, because that is the cost of the older grandchild's college textbooks this term.  How much money should she give to each grandchild?</p>

            <p>As always, we start solving a word problem by defining the variables, including their units. Let <m>A</m> be the dollar amount she gives to her older grandchild, and <m>B</m> be the dollar amount she gives to her younger grandchild. Since the total she has to give is <m>\$1000</m>, we can say that <m>A+B=1000</m>. Since she wants to give <m>\$120</m> more to the older grandchild, we can say that the difference between the amounts is <m>\$120</m>, or translated as a linear equation, <m>A-B=120</m>. This gives us two linear equations, which together makes a system of linear equations:<md>
                <mrow>
                    \left\{
                        \begin{aligned}
                            A+B \amp = 1000 \\
                            A-B \amp = 120
                        \end{aligned}
                    \right.
                </mrow>
            </md></p>

            <p>We can solve this system by either substitution as we learned in <xref ref="section-substitution">Section</xref> or by elimination as we learned in <xref ref="section-elimination">Section</xref>. Notice that if we add together the <em>left</em> sides from the two equations, the variable <m>B</m> will be eliminated quite easily:<md>
                <mrow>\begin{aligned}A+B\\{}+A-B\end{aligned}\amp=\begin{aligned}1000\\{}+120\end{aligned}</mrow>
                <intertext>So we have:</intertext>
                <mrow>2A\amp=1120</mrow>
            </md></p>

            <p>Thus, the elimination method is an easy method to use and it doesn't take much to finish solving for <m>A</m>:<md>
                <mrow>2A\amp=1120</mrow>
                <!-- <mrow>\divideunder{2A}{2}\amp=\divideunder{1120}{2}</mrow> -->
                <mrow>A\amp=560</mrow>
            </md></p>

            <p>To finish solving this system of equations, we need the value of <m>B</m>. For now, an easy way to find <m>B</m> is to substitute in our value of <m>A</m> into one of the original equations:<md>
                <mrow>A+B\amp=1000</mrow>
                <mrow>\substitute{560}+B\amp=1000</mrow>
                <!-- <mrow>560+B\subtractright{560}\amp=1000\subtractright{560}</mrow> -->
                <mrow>B\amp=440</mrow>
            </md>To check our work, substitute <m>A=560</m> and <m>B=440</m> into the original equations:<md>
                <mrow>A+B\amp=1000\amp A-B\amp=120</mrow>
                <mrow>\substitute{560}+\substitute{440}\amp\stackrel{?}{=}1000\amp \substitute{560}-\substitute{440}\amp\stackrel{?}{=}120</mrow>
                <mrow>1000\amp\stackrel{\checkmark}{=}1000\amp 120\amp\stackrel{\checkmark}{=}120</mrow>
            </md></p>
            <p>This confirms that our solution is correct. In summary, Alicia should give <m>\$560</m> to her older grandchild and <m>\$440</m> to her younger grandchild.</p>
        </example>

    <subsection><title>Translating to a System of Equations</title>
        	<p>Many times the challenge of solving application problems is being able to translate the situations into algebraic equations. When trying to solve application problems using systems of equations, students often make the mistake of trying to combine the two separate relationships that are present in the situation. The key is to determine what the <em>two separate</em> relationships are and then to keep in mind that these <em>two</em> relationships will be the basis of the <em>two</em> equations that will make up your system.</p>

        	<p>Let's look at a couple of examples, where we will simply translate each problem into a system of linear equations, using steps 1-4 from the list of strategies above. We will not worry about solving these problems.</p>

    	<example><p>Translate to a system of equations:

    		A married couple together earns $110,000 a year. The wife earns $16,000 less than twice what her husband earns. What does the husband earn? What does the wife earn?</p>

    		<p>Here, we'll use steps 1-4 from the list of strategies given above.</p>
    			<sbsgroup widths="28% 28% 38%">
    			<sidebyside margins="0%">
    				<p>Step 1: Read the problem. Make sure you understand all the words and ideas.</p>
    				<p>This is a problem relating the annual salaries of two people.</p>
    				<p>Together they make a total of $110,000 annually and the wife makes $16,000 less than two times the husband's salary.</p>
				</sidebyside>
				<sidebyside margins="0%">
    				<p>Step 2: Identify what you are looking for.</p>
    				<p>"What does the husband earn? What does the wife earn?"</p>
    				<p>We need to find how much the husband earns and how much the wife earns, per year.</p>
    			</sidebyside>
    			<sidebyside margins="0%">
    				<p>Step 3: Name what you are looking for by choosing variables to represent those quantities.</p>
    				<p>We will use two variables, <m>h</m> and <m>w</m>.</p>
    				<p>Let <m>h</m> represent the husband's annual salary, in dollars, and let <m>w</m> represent the wife's annual salary, in dollars.</p>
				</sidebyside>
				<sidebyside margins="0%">
    				<p>Step 4: Translate into a system of equations.</p>
    				<p>We will write one equation for each sentence.</p>
					<p>
						<me>\underbrace{\text{Together their total annual salary }}_{h+w}\underbrace{\text{is}}_{=}\underbrace{\text{\$110,000}}_{110000}
						</me>

        				<me>\underbrace{\text{The wife's annual salary}}_{w}\underbrace{\text{is}}_{=}\underbrace{\text{\$16,000 less than 2 times the husband's salary}}_{2h-16000}</me>

        				<me>\text{Here is our system of equations:}</me>

    <subsection><title>Direct Translation Applications</title>
        <introduction><p>In the previous examples, we learned how to translate application problems into systems of linear equations, but we didn't actually solve those problems. Now we'll translate a situation to a system of equations and then solve the system, using what we learned in <xref ref="section-substitution">Section</xref> and <xref ref="section-elimination">Section</xref>.</p></introduction>

        <example><p>Translate to a system of equations and then solve: Devon is 26 years older than his son Cooper. The sum of their ages is 50. Find their ages.</p>

            <p>The measure of the larger angle is <var name="$answer1" width="5"/> degrees and the measure of the smaller angle is <var name="$answer2" width="5"/> degrees.</p>
            </statement>

            <solution><p>We are looking for the measure of each of the two angles. So let <m>x</m> represent the measure of the larger angle and <m>y</m> represent the measure of the smaller angle.</p> 

            <p>The two angles are supplementary angles, which means the sum of the measures of their angles is <m>180</m> degrees. This gives us one equation for our system:
                    <me>x+y=180</me></p>

            <p>The measure of the larger angle is <m>12</m> degrees more than three times the smaller angle. This translates into the following equation:
                    <me>x=3y+12</me></p>

            <p>Hence, our system is as follows:
                <me>\begin{cases} x + y = 180 \\ x = 3y + 12 \end{cases}
                    </me></p>

            <p>This system can be easily solved by substitution since the second equation already has <m>x</m> isolated. Thus, the first step in solving this system is to substitute the expression <m>3y+12</m> in place of <m>x</m> in the first equation. This will give us:<md>
                <mrow>(\substitute{3y+12})+y=180</mrow>
                <mrow>4y+12=180</mrow>
                <mrow>4y=168</mrow>
                <mrow>y=42</mrow></md></p>

            <p>Therefore, the smaller angle has a measure of <m>42</m> degrees.</p>

            <p>To find the measure of the larger angle, we can substitute <m>42</m> in place of <m>y</m> in the second equation:<md>
                <mrow>x=3(\substitute{42})+12</mrow>
                <mrow>x=126+12</mrow>
                <mrow>x=138</mrow></md></p>

            <p>Thus, the measure of the larger angle is <m>138</m> degrees. The check is left to the reader.</p>

            <statement><p>Translate to a system of equations and then solve: A rectangular pool has a perimeter of 68 yards and its length is two yards longer than three times its width. Find the dimensions of the pool.</p>

            <p>The length of the pool is <var name="$answer1" width="5"/> yards and the width is <var name="$answer2" width="5"/> yards.</p>
            </statement>

            <solution><p>We are looking for the length and width of the rectangular pool. So let <m>L</m> represent the length and <m>W</m> represent the width.</p> 

            <p>The perimeter of the rectangular pool is <m>68</m> yards. Using the perimeter formula, this gives us one equation for our system:
                    <me>68=2L+2W</me></p>

            <p>The length of the pool is two yards longer than three times its width. This translates into the following equation:
                    <me>L=3W+2</me></p>

            <p>Hence, our system is as follows:
                <me>\begin{cases} 68=2L+2W \\ L=3W+2 \end{cases}
                    </me></p>

            <p>This system can be easily solved by substitution since the second equation already has <m>L</m> isolated. Thus, the first step in solving this system is to substitute the expression <m>3W+2</m> in place of <m>L</m> in the first equation. Then, we solve for <m>W</m>. This will give us:<md>
                <mrow>68=2(\substitute{3W+2})+2W</mrow>
                <mrow>68=6W+4+2W</mrow>

                <mrow>64=8W</mrow>
                <mrow>W=8</mrow></md></p>

            <p>Therefore, the width of the pool is <m>8</m> yards.</p>

            <p>To find the length of the pool, we can substitute <m>8</m> in place of <m>W</m> in the second equation:<md>
                <mrow>L=3(\substitute{8})+2</mrow>
                <mrow>L=24+2</mrow>
                <mrow>L=26</mrow></md></p>

            <p>Thus, length of the pool is <m>26</m> yards. The check is left to the reader.</p>

    <subsection><title>Uniform Motion Applications</title><idx><h>uniform motion applications</h></idx>

        <introduction><p>The basic equation we use in uniform motion problems is <m>d=rt</m> where <m>d</m> is the distance traveled, <m>r</m> is the rate or speed at which the person or object is traveling, and <m>t</m> is the time the person or object has traveled. For these problems, we will learn how to use a table to organize our information, which will help us to translate the situation into a system of equations.</p></introduction>

        <example xml:id="example-catch-up-driving"><p>Translate to a system of equations and then solve: Joni left St. Louis on the interstate, driving west toward Denver at a speed of 65 miles per hour. Half an hour later, Kelly left St. Louis on the same route as Joni, driving 78 miles per hour. How long will it take Kelly to catch up to Joni?</p>

            <p>A diagram is useful in helping us visualize the situation.

            <figure><image source="images/CNX_ElemAlg_Figure_05_04_006_img.jpg" width="50%"><description>A diagram with "Denver" on the left and "St. Louis" on the right. Then, two arrows pointing from St. Louis to Denver, one Labeled with "Joni" and the other with "Kelly (1/2 hour later)" and speeds of 65 mph and 78 mph labeled on each arrow respectively.</description></image>
            </figure></p>


            <p><em>Identify and name</em> what we are looking for. A table will help us organize the information. We know the rates of both Joni and Kelly, and so we enter them in the table. We don't know how long they have been driving at those rates, so we will let <m>j</m> represent Joni's time, in hours, and let <m>k</m> represent Kelly's time, in hours, and enter that information into the table as well. Then, we can multiply the rates and times together to obtain an expression for each person's distance.</p>

            <p><figure><image source="images/CNX_ElemAlg_Figure_05_04_013a_img.jpg" width="60%"><description>A table with column headings of type, rate, time, and distance. The types are Joni and Kelly. The rates are 65 and 78. The times are variables j and k. The distances are 65j and 78j.</description></image>
            </figure></p>

            <p><em>Translate</em> into a system of equations. To make the system of equations, we must recognize that Kelly and Joni will drive the same distance. So, <m>65j=78k</m>.</p>

            <p>Also, since Kelly left later, her time will be <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> hour less than Joni's time. So, <m>k=j-\frac{1}{2}</m>. Now we have a system:
            <md>
                <mrow>
                    \left\{
                        \begin{alignedat}{4}
                        65j\amp {}={} \amp 78k \\
                        k\amp {}={} j \amp {}-{} \amp \frac{1}{2}
                        \end{alignedat}
                    \right.
                </mrow></md>
            </p>

            <p><em>Solve</em> the system of equations, either by substitution or elimination. This system, lends itself easily to substitution since <m>k</m> is already isolated in the second equation. Thus, we can substitute the expression <m>j-\frac{1}{2}</m> in place of <m>k</m> in the first equation:
            <md>
                <mrow>65j=78\left(\substitute{j-\frac{1}{2}}\right)</mrow>
                <mrow>65j=78j-39</mrow>
                <mrow>-13j=-39</mrow>
                <mrow>j=3</mrow>
            </md></p>
            <p>Substitute <m>3</m> for <m>j</m> in the second equation and solve for <m>k</m>:<md>
                <mrow>k=\substitute{3}-\frac{1}{2}</mrow>
                <mrow>k=2.5</mrow></md></p>
            <p>Therefore, it will take Kelly <m>2.5</m> hours to catch up to Joni. The check is left to the reader.</p>

            </statement>
            <solution><p><em>Identify and name</em> what you are looking for. Make a table, similar to the one we used in <xref ref="example-catch-up-driving">Example</xref> to help you organize the information. We are given the rates of both Charlie and Sally, and so you can enter them into your table. We don't know how long they have been driving at those rates, so you can let <m>c</m> represent Charlie's time, in hours, and let <m>s</m> represent Sally's time, in hours, and enter that information into the table as well.

            <p>Next you need to translate into a system of equations. To make the system of equations, you should recognize that Charlie and Sally will have driven the same distance once Sally has caught up to Charlie. So, <m>36c=48s</m>.</p>

            <p>Also, since Sally left <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> hour later, her time will be <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> hour less than Charlie's time. So, <m>s=c-\frac{1}{4}</m>. Now we have a system:

                <me>\begin{cases} 36c = 48s \\ s = c - \frac{1}{4} \end{cases}

            <p>Now solve the system of equations, either by substitution or elimination. This system, lends itself easily to substitution since <m>s</m> is already isolated in the second equation.

            <p>Note that all we were asked to find is how long Charlie will have been driving before Sally catches up, so we don't need to go any further. We now know that Charlie had been driving for <m>1</m> hour before Sally caught up with him.</p>

        <p> Many real-world applications of uniform motion arise because of the effects of currents - of water or air - on the actual speed of a vehicle. For example, cross-country airplane flights in the United States generally take longer going west than going east because of the prevailing wind currents.</p>

        <p>Let's take a look at a boat traveling on a river. Depending on which way the boat is going, the curent of the water is either slowing it down or speeding it up.</p>

        <p><xref ref="figure-downstream">Figure</xref> and <xref ref="figure-upstream">Figure</xref> show how a river current affects the speed at which a boat is actually traveling. We'll call the speed of the boat in still water <m>b</m> and the speed of the river current <m>c</m>.</p>

        <p>In <xref ref="figure-downstream">Figure</xref> the boat is going downstream, in the same direction as the river current. The current helps push the boat, so the boat's actual speed is faster than its speed in still water. The actual speed at which the boat is moving is <m>b+c</m>.</p>

            <p><figure xml:id="figure-downstream"><image source="images/CNX_ElemAlg_Figure_05_04_007_img.jpg" width="60%"><description>A picture of a boat traveling downstream, with the current.</description></image>
            </figure></p> 

        <p>In <xref ref="figure-upstream">Figure</xref> the boat is going upstream, opposite the river current. The current is going against the boat, so the boat's actual speed is slower than its speed in still water. The actual speed of the boat is <m>b-c</m>.</p>

             <p><figure xml:id="figure-upstream"><image source="images/CNX_ElemAlg_Figure_05_04_008_img.jpg" width="60%"><description>A picture of a boat traveling upstream, against the current.</description></image>
            </figure></p> 

        <p>We'll put some numbers to this situation in the next example.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-river-cruise-ship"><p>Translate to a system of equations and then solve: A river cruise ship sailed <m>60</m> miles downstream for <m>4</m> hours and then took <m>5</m> hours sailing upstream to return to the dock. Find the speed of the ship in still water and the speed of the current.</p>

        <p>A diagram is useful in helping us visualize the situation.

            <figure><image source="images/CNX_ElemAlg_Figure_05_04_009_img.jpg" width="50%"><description>A diagram showing two arrows pointing in opposite directions, to represent a boat traveling one direction and then traveling back in the opposite direction the same distance. Then one blue arrow represents the direction of the current of the river.</description></image>
            </figure></p>


            <p><em>Identify and name</em> what we are looking for. A table will help us organize the information, including the use of the formula <m>d=rt</m>. We know the times of both trips downstream and upstream, and so we enter those times in the table. We also know that the distance for both trips is <m>60</m> miles, so we can also enter that information into the table. We don't know the ship's speed in still water or the speed of the current, so we will let <m>s</m> represent the ship's speed, in miles per hour, in still water and let <m>c</m> represent the speed of the current, in miles per hour.</p>

            <p>As explained previously, when the ship is going downstream, the current will push the ship faster, so the rate at which the ship is traveling can be represented by <m>s+c</m>. When the ship is going upstream, the current will slow the ship down, so the rate at which the ship will be traveling can be represented by <m>s-c</m>. We can now enter that information into the table as well.</p>

            <p><figure><image source="images/CNX_ElemAlg_Figure_05_04_010a_img.jpg" width="60%"><description>A table with column headings of rate, time, and distance, as well as row headings of downstream and upstream. The rates are s+c and s-c. The times are 4 and 5. The distances are both 60.</description></image>
            </figure></p>

            <p><em>Translate</em> into a system of equations. To make the system of equations, we use the fact that the product of the rate and the time is equal to the distance for each trip. This will give us our two equations: 

                <me>\begin{cases}
                        4(s+c)=60\\5(s-c)=60
                        \end{cases}
                </me></p>

            <p><em>Solve</em> the system of equations, either by substitution or elimination. The first thing to do is simplify each equation by using the distributive property to get rid of the parentheses:
            
                <me>\begin{cases}
                        4s+4c=60\\5s-5c=60
                        \end{cases}
                </me></p>

            <p>Since all the variable terms have a coefficient (not equal to one), the best method to use to solve this system is the elimination method.</p>

            <p>Notice that the <m>c</m> terms already have opposite signs, so we'll work to eliminate the variable <m>c</m>. The least common mutiple of <m>4</m> and <m>5</m> is <m>20</m>, so if we multiply both sides of the first equation by <m>5</m> and both sides of the second equation by <m>4</m>, then the new <m>c</m> terms will be <m>20c</m> and <m>-20c</m> respectively, which eliminate the <m>c</m> terms when the new equations are added together.</p>

            <p>Multiply both sides of the first equation by <m>5</m> and both sides of the second equation by <m>4</m>:<md>

                    <mrow>5(4s+4c)=5(60)</mrow>
                    <mrow>4(5s-5c)=4(60)</mrow>
                    </md></p>

            <p>Now, our new system is:

                <me>\begin{cases} 20s+20c=300\\20s-20c=240
                \end{cases}</me></p>

             <p>Add the first equation to the second equation. Then, solve for <m>s</m>.</p>
                <p><md>
                    <mrow>\begin{aligned}20s+20c\\{}+20s-20c\end{aligned}\amp=\begin{aligned}300\\{}+240\end{aligned}</mrow></md>
                    So we have<md>
                    <mrow>40s=540</mrow>
                    <mrow>s=13.5</mrow></md></p>

            <p>Substitute <m>13.5</m> for <m>s</m> in the first original equation and solve for <m>c</m>:<md>
                <mrow>4(\substitute{13.5}+c)=60</mrow>
                <mrow>54+4c=60</mrow>
                <mrow>4c=6</mrow>
                <mrow>c=1.5</mrow></md></p>
            <p>Therefore, the ship's speed in still water is <m>13.5</m> miles per hour and the speed of the current is <m>1.5</m> miles per hour. The check is left to the reader.</p>

            <p>Notice that the <m>c</m> terms already have opposite signs, so we'll work to eliminate the variable <m>c</m>. The least common mutiple of <m>4</m> and <m>3</m> is <m>12</m>, so if we multiply both sides of the first equation by <m>3</m> and both sides of the second equation by <m>4</m>, then the new <m>c</m> terms will be <m>-12c</m> and <m>12c</m> respectively, which eliminate the <m>c</m> terms when we add the new equations together.</p>

            <p>Multiply both sides of the first equation by <m>3</m> and both sides of the second equation by <m>4</m>:<md>

                    <mrow>3(4b-4c)=3(24)</mrow>
                    <mrow>4(3b+3c)=4(24)</mrow>
                    </md></p>

            <p>Now, our new system is:

                <me>\begin{cases} 12b-12c=72\\12b+12c=96
                \end{cases}</me></p>

             <p>Add the first equation to the second equation. Then, solve for <m>b</m>.</p>
                <p><md>
                    <mrow>\begin{aligned}12b-12c\\{}+12b+12c\end{aligned}\amp=\begin{aligned}72\\{}+96\end{aligned}</mrow></md>
                    So we have<md>
                    <mrow>24b=168</mrow>
                    <mrow>b=7</mrow></md></p>

            <p>Substitute <m>7</m> for <m>b</m> in the first original equation and solve for <m>c</m>:<md>
                <mrow>4(\substitute{7}-c)=24</mrow>

            <p>Therefore, the canoe's speed in still water is <m>7</m> miles per hour and the speed of the current is <m>1</m> mile per hour. The check is left to the reader.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-private-jet"><statement><p>Translate to a system of equations and then solve: A private jet can fly <m>1095</m> miles in three hours with a tailwind, but only <m>987</m> miles into a headwind in the same amount of time. Find the speed of the jet in still air and the speed of the wind.</p></statement>

        <solution>

        <p>A diagram is useful in helping us visualize the situation.

            <figure><image source="images/CNX_ElemAlg_Figure_05_04_011_img.jpg" width="50%"><description>A diagram showing two arrows pointing in opposite directions, to represent a jet traveling one direction for a distance of 1095 miles and then traveling back in the opposite direction for a distance of 987 miles. Then one blue arrow represents the direction of the wind, with the time of 3 hours labeled on that arrow, representing the time traveled by the jet in both directions. There are also expressions of "j+w" labeling the arrow that represents the 1095-mile trip and "j-w" labeling the arrow that represents the 987-mile trip.</description></image>
            </figure></p>


            <p><em>Identify and name</em> what we are looking for. A table will help us organize the information, including the use of the formula <m>d=rt</m>. The time of both trips is given to be three hours and so we enter that time in the table, in the appropriate spots. We also know the distances for each trip, which is <m>1095</m> miles with a tailwind and <m>987</m> miles into a headwind, so we can also enter that information into the table. We don't know the jet's speed in still air or the speed of the wind, so we will let <m>j</m> represent the jet's speed in still air and let <m>w</m> represent the speed of the wind, both in miles per hour.</p>

            <p>Note that when the jet is flying with the tailwind, that means the wind will be pushing the jet faster than it would be going in still air, so we can represent its rate with the tailwind as <m>j+w</m>. In contrast, when the jet is flying into the tailwind, the wind will slow the jet down, making it go slower than it would be traveling in still air, so we can represent its rate into the tailwind as <m>j-w</m>. These expressions can then be entered into the table for each rate.</p>

            <p><figure><image source="images/CNX_ElemAlg_Figure_05_04_012a_img.jpg" width="60%"><description>A table with column headings of rate, time, and distance, as well as row headings of tailwind and headwind. The rates are j+w and j-w. The times are both 3. The distances are 1095 for tailwind and 987 for headwind.</description></image>
            </figure></p>

            <p><em>Translate</em> into a system of equations. To make the system of equations, we use the fact that the product of the rate and the time is equal to the distance for each trip. This will give us our two equations, making up our system: 

                <me>\begin{cases}
                        3(j+w)=1095\\3(j-w)=987
                        \end{cases}
                </me></p>

            <p><em>Solve</em> the system of equations, either by substitution or elimination. The first thing to do is simplify each equation by using the distributive property to get rid of the parentheses:
            
                <me>\begin{cases}
                        3j+3w=1095\\3j-3w=987
                        \end{cases}
                </me></p>

            <p>The best method to use to solve this system is the elimination method since the <m>w</m> terms of the two equations add to zero.</p>

             <p>Add the first equation to the second equation. Then, solve for <m>j</m>.</p>

                    <mrow>\begin{aligned}3j+3w\\{}+3j-3w\end{aligned}\amp=\begin{aligned}1095\\{}+987\end{aligned}</mrow></md>
                    So we have<md>
                    <mrow>6j=2082</mrow>
                    <mrow>j=347</mrow></md></p>

            <p>Substitute <m>347</m> for <m>j</m> in the first original equation and solve for <m>w</m>:<md>
                <mrow>3(\substitute{347}+w)=1095</mrow>
                <mrow>1041+3w=1095</mrow>
                <mrow>3w=54</mrow>
                <mrow>w=18</mrow></md></p>
            <p>Therefore, the jet's speed in still air is <m>347</m> miles per hour and the speed of the wind is <m>18</m> miles per hour. The check is left to the reader.</p>

        <p>Some mixture applications involve combining foods or drinks. Example situations might include combining raisins and nuts to make a trail mix or using two types of coffee beans to make a blend.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-solving-systems-of-equations-trail-mix-application">
        <title>Combining Foods with Different Costs</title><idx><h>mixture problem</h></idx>

            <statement><p>Translate to a system of equations and solve: Carson wants to make <m>20</m> pounds of trail mix using nuts and chocolate chips.

How many pounds of nuts and how many pounds of chocolate chips should he use?</p></statement>

            <solution><p><em>Read</em> the problem. We will create a table to organize the information. Note that with mixture problems, when mixing two ingredients, we will have one row for each ingredient and one total row for the final mixture, giving us three rows in our table.</p>

                <p><em>Name</em> what we are looking for.</p>


                <p>The two unknowns are the amount of each type of solution being mixed together. Let <m>x</m> represent the amount of <m>25\%</m> solution (in <quantity><unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/></quantity>) and let <m>y</m> represent the amount of <m>50\%</m> solution (in <quantity><unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/></quantity>). One quantity given to us in the problem is <quantity><mag>200</mag><unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/></quantity>, which is the amount of the <m>40\%</m> solution that needs to be created.</p>

                <p>These three amounts, as well as the concentrations for each type of solution, can be entered into the table and then the amount of sulfuric acid in each type of solution can be calculated by multiplying the number of milliters of solution times the concentration (in decimal form).</p>

                <p><figure><image source="images/CNX_ElemAlg_Figure_05_05_004b_img.jpg" width="60%"><description>A table with column headings of type, number of units, concentration(\%), and amount. For the types, there are 25\%, 50\%, and 40\%. The number of units are x, y, and 200. The amounts are 0.25x, 0.50y, and 0.40(200).</description></image></figure></p>

                <p><em>Translate</em> into a system of equations. Since <m>200</m> <quantity><unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/></quantity> is the total volume of the <m>40\%</m> solution, we must have for one of the equations in the system:
                    <me>(x\,\text{mL})+(y\,\text{mL})=200\,\text{mL}</me>
                Or without units:
                    <me>x+y=200</me>
                </p>

                <p>To build the second equation, we have to think about the  <em>amount</em> (in <quantity><unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/></quantity>) of <em>sulfuric acid</em> being mixed. If we have <m>x</m> milliliters of solution that is <m>25\%</m> sulfuric acid, then <m>0.25x</m> is the actual <em>amount</em> (in <quantity><unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/></quantity>) of sulfuric acid in that solution. Similarly, <m>0.50y</m> is the amount of sulfuric acid in the <m>50\%</m> solution. The final solution is <quantity><mag>200</mag><unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/></quantity> of solution that is <m>40\%</m> sulfuric acid, so it has <m>0.40(200)=80</m> <quantity><unit prefix="milli" base="liter"/></quantity> of sulfuric acid. All of this together means:
                    <me>0.25(x\,\text{mL})+0.50(y\,\text{mL})=80\,\text{mL}</me>
                Or without units:
                    <me>0.25x+0.50y=80</me>
                </p>
                <p>So our system is:
                    <me>
                        \left\{

    <subsection><title>Interest Applications</title>

        <introduction><p>The formula to model interest applications is <m>I=Prt</m>. Interest earned or owed, <m>I</m>, is the product of the principal, <m>P</m>, the rate, <m>r</m>, and the time (in years), <m>t</m>.</p>

        <p>In these interest application problems, we'll use a table to organize the information, similar to uniform motion and mixture applications, as you'll see in <xref ref="example-solving-system-of-equations-interest-application">Example</xref>.</p></introduction>

        <example xml:id="example-solving-system-of-equations-interest-application">
            <title>Investing at Two Different Interest Rates</title>
            <p>Adrian invested <m>\$40{,}000</m> last year. He put some of the money into a stock fund that earns <m>8\%</m> per year and the rest into bonds that earns <m>3\%</m> per year. If he earned a total of <m>\$2840</m> in interest that year, how much money did he put into each fund?</p>

            <p><em>Read</em> the problem. A table will help us organize the information.</p>

            <p><em>Identify</em> what we are looking for. We are looking for the amount to invest in each fund.</p>

            <p><em>Name</em> what we are looking for. Let <m>s</m> represent the amount, in dollars, invested in a stock fund and let <m>b</m> represent the amount, in dollars, invested in bonds. Write these in the table under Principal for each account.</p>

            <p>Write the interest rate (in decimal form) for each fund. We're interested in the amount of interest earned per year, so the time will be <m>1</m> year for both the stock fund and the bonds. Multiply: Principal <m>\cdot</m> Rate <m>\cdot</m> Time to get the Interest for each account as well as the total.</p>

            <p><figure><image source="images/CNX_ElemAlg_Figure_05_05_005a_img.png" width="75%"><description>A table with column headings of Account, Principal, Rate, Time, and Interest, and row headings of Stock fund, Bonds, and Total.

            <p><em>Translate</em> into a system of equations. We get our system of equations from the Principal column and the Interest column, since the amounts invested in each account should add together to equal the total amount invested and the amounts of interest earned in each account added together should equal the total amount of interest earned. So here is our system:<md>

            <p>To find <m>b</m>, substitute <m>32{,}800</m> in for <m>s</m> in the first equation and solve for <m>b</m>:<md>

                    <mrow>b=7200</mrow>

            <p><em>Check</em> the answer in the problem. Do the two amounts invested add to <m>\$40{,}000</m>? Yes! Will he earn a total of <m>7.1\%</m> interest in one year? <md>

        <example><title>Owing at Two Different Rates</title>
            <statement>
                <p>Notah made some large purchases with his two credit cards one month and took on a total of <m>\$8{,}400</m> in debt from the two cards. He didn't make any payments the first month, so the two credit card debts each started to accrue interest. That month, his Visa card charged <m>2\%</m> interest and his Mastercard charged <m>2.5\%</m> interest. Because of this, Notah's total debt grew by <m>\$178</m>. How much money did Notah charge to each card?</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>To start, we will define two variables based on our two unknowns. Let <m>v</m> be the amount charged to the Visa card (in dollars) and let <m>m</m> be the amount charged to the Mastercard (in dollars).</p>

                <p>To determine our equations, notice that we are given two different totals. We will use these to form our two equations. The total amount charged is <m>\$8{,}400</m> so we have:
                    <me>(v\,\text{dollars})+(m\,\text{dollars})=\$8400</me>
                Or without units:
                    <me>v+m=8400</me>
                The other total we were given is the total amount of interest, <m>\$178</m>, which is also in dollars. The Visa had <m>v</m> dollars charged to it and accrues <m>2\%</m> interest. So <m>0.02v</m> is the dollar amount of interest that comes from using this card. Similarly, <m>0.025m</m> is the dollar amount of interest from using the Mastercard. Together:
                    <me>0.02(v\,\text{dollars})+0.025(m\,\text{dollars})=\$178</me>
                Or without units:
                    <me>0.02v+0.025m=178</me>
                As a system, we write:
                    <me>
                        \left\{
                            \begin{alignedat}{3}
                            v\amp+{}\amp m\amp={}8400 \\
                            0.02v\amp+{}\amp 0.025m\amp{}=178 \\
                            \end{alignedat}
                        \right.
                    </me>
                </p>
                <p>To solve this system by substitution, notice that it will be easier to solve for one of the variables in the first equation. We'll solve that equation for <m>v</m>:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>v+m\amp=8400</mrow>
                        <!-- <mrow>v+m\subtractright{m}\amp=8400\subtractright{m}</mrow> -->
                        <mrow>v\amp=8400-m</mrow>
                    </md>
                Now we will substitute <m>8400-m</m> for <m>v</m> in the second equation:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>0.02v+0.025m\amp=178</mrow>
                        <mrow>0.02(\substitute{8400-m})+0.025m\amp=178</mrow>
                        <mrow>168-0.02m+0.025m\amp=178</mrow>
                        <mrow>168+0.005m\amp=178</mrow>
                        <mrow>0.005m\amp=10</mrow>
                        <mrow>\divideunder{0.005m}{0.005}\amp=\divideunder{10}{0.005}</mrow>
                        <mrow>m\amp=2000</mrow>
                    </md>
                Lastly, we can determine the value of <m>v</m> by using the earlier equation where we isolated <m>v</m>:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>v\amp=8400-m</mrow>
                        <mrow>v\amp=8400-\substitute{2000}</mrow>
                        <mrow>v\amp=6400</mrow>
                    </md>
                </p>
                <p>In summary, Notah charged <m>\$6400</m> to the Visa and <m>\$2000</m> to the Mastercard. We should check that these numbers work as solutions to our original system <em>and</em> that they make sense in context. (For instance, if one of these numbers were negative, or was something small like <m>\$0.50</m>, they wouldn't make sense as credit card debt.)</p>

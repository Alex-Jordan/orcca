    <introduction>
        <p>In the last section, we focused on solving systems of equations by graphing. In addition to being time consuming, it can be difficult determine the exact solution when it contains fractions. There are two algebraic methods for solving systems of linear equations, and in this section we will use the <term>substitution method</term>.</p>

            <title>An Example from the New York Times</title>
            <p>In 2014, the <url href="https://nyti.ms/2pupebT">New York Times</url> posted the following about the movie, <q>The Interview</q>:

                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>The Interview,</q> generated roughly <m>\$15</m> million in online sales and rentals during its first four days of availability, Sony Pictures said on Sunday.</p>

                    <p>Sony did not say how much of that total represented <m>\$6</m> digital rentals versus <m>\$15</m> sales. The studio said there were about two million transactions overall.</p>
                </blockquote>
            </p>
                
            <p>A few days later, Joey Devilla cleverly pointed out in <url href="http://www.joeydevilla.com/2014/12/31/the-new-york-times-unintentionally-provided-the-answer-to-their-question-is-algebra-necessary/">this article</url>, that there is enough information given to find the amount of sales versus rentals. Using algebra, we can write a system of equations and solve it to find the two quantities.
            </p>
            <p>First, we will define our two variables. Let <m>r</m> be the number of rental transactions (in millions) and let <m>s</m> be the number of sales transactions (in millions).</p>

            <p>The article says that the total number of transactions is 2 million, so our first equation will add the total number of rental and sales transactions to equal 2 million. Our equation is:
                <me>r+s=2</me>
            </p>

            <p>The price of each rental was <m>\$6</m>, so the number of dollars (in millions) generated from rentals was <m>6r</m>. The price of each sale was <m>\$15</m>, so the revenue (in millions) from sales was <m>15s</m>. The total revenue was <m>\$15</m> million, which we can represent with this equation:
                <me>6r+15s=15</me>
            </p>

            <p>If you are not sure about how to write an equation, use the units to help you. The units of each term in an equation must match because we can only add like quantities. The unit of measure in the first equation is transactions. The unit of measure in the second equation is dollars. Here is our system of equations:
                <me>\left\{
                    \begin{alignedat}{4}
                    r\amp{}+{}\amp s\amp{}={}\amp2 \\
                    6r\amp{}+{}\amp 15s\amp{}={}\amp15
                    \end{alignedat}
                \right.
                </me>
            To solve the system, we will use the <term>substitution method</term>. We will take an expression that is equivalent to <m>r</m> from one equation and <em>substitute</em> it into the other equation. It is easier to solve for <m>r</m> in the first equation so that is where we will begin:
                <md>
                    <mrow>r+s \amp=2 </mrow>
                    <mrow>r+s \subtractright{s} \amp=2\subtractright{s} </mrow>
                    <mrow>r \amp=2-s</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            <p>This tells us that the expression <m>2-s</m> is equivalent to r, so we can <em>substitute</em> it for <m>r</m> in the second equation:
                <md>
                    <mrow>6r+15s \amp=15</mrow>
                    <mrow>6(\substitute{2-s})+15s \amp=15</mrow>
                </md>
            Now we have an equation with only one variable, which we will solve for <m>s</m>:
                <md>
                    <mrow>6(2-s)+15s \amp=15</mrow>
                    <mrow>12-6s+15s \amp=15</mrow>
                    <mrow>12+9s \amp= 15</mrow>
                    <mrow>12+9s\subtractright{12} \amp= 15\subtractright{12}</mrow>
                    <mrow>9s \amp= 3</mrow>
                    <mrow>\divideunder{9s}{9} \amp= \divideunder{3}{9}</mrow>
                    <mrow>s \amp= \frac{1}{3}</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            <p>At this point, we know that <m>s=\frac{1}{3}</m>. This tells us that out of the <m>2</m> million transactions, <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> million were from online sales. We can mentally determine that this leaves <m>1\frac{2}{3}</m> million rental transactions. Algebraically, recall that we have already solved the first equation for r. To find r, we will replace <m>s</m> with <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> in that equation.
                <md>
                    <mrow>r \amp=2-s</mrow>
                    <mrow>r \amp=2-\substitute{\frac{1}{3}}</mrow>
                    <mrow>r \amp= 1\frac{2}{3}\text{ or }\frac{5}{3}</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            
            <p>To check our answer, we will see if <m>s=\frac{1}{3}</m> and <m>r=\frac{5}{3}</m> make both equations true:
            <md>
                <mrow>r+s \amp=2</mrow>
                <mrow>\substitute{\frac{5}{3}}+\substitute{\frac{1}{3}} \amp\stackrel{?}{=}2</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{6}{3} \amp\stackrel{\checkmark}{=}2</mrow>
            </md>
            <intertext>and</intertext>
            <md>
                <mrow>6r+15s \amp=15</mrow>
                <mrow>6\left(\substitute{\frac{5}{3}}\right)+15\left(\substitute{\frac{1}{3}}\right) \amp\stackrel{?}{=}15</mrow>
                <mrow>10+5 \amp\stackrel{\checkmark}{=}15</mrow>
            </md>
            </p>

            <p>In summary, the number of sales was <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> million (or <m>333{,}333</m> copies sold) and the number of rentals was <m>1\frac{2}{3}</m> million (or <m>1{,}666{,}667</m> copies rented).
            </p>
        </example>  

        <remark>
            <p>In <xref ref="example-systems-of-equations-substitution-intro">Example</xref>, we <em>chose</em> to solve the equation <m>r+s=2</m> for <m>r</m>. We could have instead solved for <m>s</m>. In that case we would have found <m>s=\frac{5}{3}</m> first, and then <m>r=\frac{1}{3}</m>.</p>
            <p>Similarly, in solving for the second variable, we used the equation that was already solved for <m>r</m>. We could have used either of the original equations to find <m>s</m>. We will look for the way with the fewest steps.</p>
        </remark>

                <p>Solve the system of equations using the substitution method:

                </p>            
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>To begin, we need to solve for one of the variables in one of our equations. Looking at both equations, it will be easiest to solve for <m>x</m> in the first equation:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>x+2y\amp=8</mrow>
                        <mrow>x+2y\subtractright{2y}\amp=8\subtractright{2y}</mrow>
                        <mrow>x\amp= 8-2y</mrow>
                    </md>
                </p>

                <p>Next, we will replace <m>x</m> in the second equation with <m>8-2y</m>. This will give us a linear equation in one variable that we can solve for <m>y</m>:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>3x-2y\amp=8</mrow>
                        <mrow>3(\substitute{8-2y})-2y\amp=8</mrow>
                        <mrow>24-6y-2y\amp=8</mrow>

                    </md>
                </p>
                <p>Now that we have the value for <m>y</m>, we need to find the value for <m>x</m>. We have already solved the first equation for <m>x</m>, so that is the easiest equation to use.
                    <md>
                        <mrow>x\amp= 8-2y</mrow>

                    </md>
                </p>

                <p>To check this solution, we replace <m>x</m> with <m>4</m> and <m>y</m> with <m>2</m> in each equation:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>x+2y\amp=8</mrow>

                    </md>
                    <intertext>and</intertext>
                    <md>
                        <mrow>3x-2y\amp=8</mrow>                        
                        <mrow>3\substitute{(4)}-2\substitute{(2)}\amp\stackrel{?}{=}8</mrow>

                    </md>
                </p>

                <p>We conclude then that this system of equations is true when <m>x=4</m> and <m>y=2</m>. Our solution is the point <m>(4,2)</m> and we write the solution set as <m>\{(4,2)\}</m>.</p>

            <solution>
                <p>Before solving, we will remove the fractions in both equations. We will multiply the first equation by the least common denominator of <m>6</m>:<md>

                        \right.
                </mrow></md>The second equation is already solved for <m>x</m>, so we will replace <m>x</m> in the first equation with <m>2y+4</m>, and we have:<md>

        <title>Setting up and Solving Applications of Systems of Equations</title>
        
        <p>In <xref ref="example-systems-of-equations-substitution-intro">Example</xref>, we set up and solved a system of equations for a real-world application. Here are some more scenarios that we can model with systems of equations.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-solving-system-of-equations-interest-application">
            <title>Accounts with Two Different Interest Rates</title>
            <statement>
                <p>Greta invested <m>\$8{,}000</m> in two accounts. Over one year, Account A earned <m>2\%</m> interest and Account B earned <m>5\%</m> interest. Greta earned a total of <m>\$220</m> in interest that year. How much money did Greta invest in each account?</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>To start, we will define two variables based on our two unknowns. Let <m>a</m> be the amount invested into account A (in dollars) and let <m>b</m> be the amount invested into account B (in dollars).</p>
                <p>To determine our equations, notice that we are given two different totals. We will use these to form our two equations. The total amount invested is <m>\$8{,}000</m> so we have:
                    <me>a+b=8000</me>
                Next, we will look at the total interest. Since account A earns interest at a rate of <m>2\%</m>, we find the amount of interest by multiplying <m>a</m> by <m>0.02</m>, which is <m>0.02a</m>. Similarly, account B earns interest at a rate of <m>5\%</m>, so we can represent the amount of interest from that account with <m>0.05b</m>. Our equation is then:
                    <me>0.02a+0.05b=220</me>
                As a system, we write:
                    <me>
                <!-- TODO: Please align a's and b's in the system -->
                        \left\{
                            \begin{alignedat}{3}
                            a+b\amp=8000 \\
                            0.02a+0.05b\amp=220 \\
                            \end{alignedat}
                        \right.
                    </me>
                </p>
                <p>To solve this system by subsitution, notice that it will be easier to solve for one of the variables in the first equation. We'll solve that equation for <m>a</m>:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>a+b\amp=8000</mrow>

                        <mrow>a\amp=8000-b</mrow>
                    </md>
                Now we will substitute <m>8000-b</m> for <m>a</m> in the second equation: 
                    <md>
                        <mrow>0.02a+0.05b\amp=220</mrow>
                        <mrow>0.02(\substitute{8000-b})+0.05b\amp=220</mrow>
                        <mrow>160-0.02b+0.05b\amp=220</mrow>
                        <mrow>160+0.03b\amp=220</mrow>

                        <mrow>b\amp=2000</mrow>
                    </md>
                Finally, we can determine the value of <m>a</m> by substituting <m>b=2000</m> into the equation that is solved for <m>a</m>:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>a\amp=8000-b</mrow>
                        <mrow>a\amp=8000-\substitute{2000}</mrow>
                        <mrow>a\amp=6000</mrow>
                    </md>
                </p>
                <p>In summary, the amount invested into account A was <m>\$6{,}000</m> and the amount invested into account B was <m>\$2{,}000</m>.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>The next three examples are called <term>mixture problems</term>, because they involve mixing two quantities together to form a combination and we want to find out how much of each quantity to mix.</p>


        <example xml:id="example-solving-systems-of-equations-chemistry-solution-application">
            <title>Mixing Solutions with Two Different Concentrations</title>

            <statement>
                <p>LaVonda is a chemist and she needs <m>400</m> milliliters of a <m>6\%</m> saline solution, but she only has <m>3\%</m> saline and <m>8\%</m> saline solutions in the lab. How many milliliters of each solution should she mix together to make the concentration she needs?</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>The two unknowns are the quantities of each saline solution. Let <m>x</m> be the amount of <m>3\%</m> saline solution (in ml) and let <m>y</m> be the amount of <m>8\%</m> saline solution (in ml).</p>
                <p>For our first equation, the total amount of saline solution needed is <m>400</m> ml, so we write:
                    <me>x+y=400</me>
                </p>
                <p>The key to the second equation is that the concentration of each solution is multiplied by the number of milliliters in the solution. This gives us the amount of pure salt in each solution and in the mixture. We will multiply the percentage by the amount for each term to get our equation:
                    <me>0.03x+0.08y=0.06(400)</me>
                </p>
                <p>So our system is:
                <!-- TODO: Please align x's and y's and constants in the system -->
                    <me>
                        \left\{

                            0.03x+0.08y\amp=0.06(400)

                        \right.
                    </me>
                </p>
                <p>To solve this system, we'll solve for <m>y</m> in the first equation:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>x+y\amp=400</mrow>
                        <mrow>y\amp=400-x</mrow>
                    </md>
                Next we will replace <m>y</m> in the second equation with <m>400-x</m> and solve for <m>x</m>:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>0.03x+0.08y\amp=24</mrow>
                        <mrow>0.03x+0.08(\substitute{400-x})\amp=24</mrow>
                        <mrow>0.03x+32-0.08x\amp=24</mrow>
                        <mrow>-0.05x+32\amp=24</mrow>
                        <mrow>-0.05x\amp=-8</mrow>

                        <mrow>x\amp=160</mrow>
                    </md>
                As a last step, we will determine <m>y</m> by substituting the value of <m>x</m>:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>y\amp=400-x</mrow>
                        <mrow>y\amp=400-\substitute{160}</mrow>
                        <mrow>y\amp=240</mrow>
                    </md>
                </p>
                <p>In summary, LaVonda needs to combine <m>160</m> ml of the <m>3\%</m> saline solution with <m>240</m> ml of the <m>8\%</m> saline solution to create <m>400</m> ml of solution with a <m>6\%</m> concentration.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>As a check for <xref ref="example-solving-systems-of-equations-chemistry-solution-application">Example</xref>, we will use <term>estimation</term> to see that our solution is reasonable. Since LaVonda is making a <m>6\%</m> solution, she would need to use more of the <m>8\%</m> concentration because <m>6\%</m> is closer to <m>8\%</m> than <m>3\%</m>. This agrees with our answer because we found that she needed <m>240</m> ml of the <m>8\%</m> solution and <m>160</m> ml of the <m>3\%</m> solution. This is an added check that we have found a reasonable solution.</p>

        <p>As another check, let's consider the possible concentrations that LaVonda could make with her two saline solutions. Could she make a 1% saline solution? How about a 10% solution? A mixture is an average of the two quantities so she can only make a concentration that is between the two that are available. Let's try an estimation problem in the next example.</p>

                    <md>
                        <mrow>C+H\amp=30</mrow>
                        <mrow>C\amp=30-H</mrow>
                    </md>
                Next, we'll replace <m>C</m> in the second equation with <m>30-H</m> and solve for <m>H</m>:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>9C+14H\amp=375</mrow>
                        <mrow>9(\substitute{30-H})+14H\amp=375</mrow>
                        <mrow>270-9H+14H\amp=375</mrow>
                        <mrow>270+5H\amp=375</mrow>
                        <mrow>5H\amp=105</mrow>
                        <mrow>H\amp=21</mrow>
                    </md>
                Since <m>H=21</m>, we can conclude that <m>C=9</m>. (We could solve this formally, but it is not nececessary.)
                </p>
                <p>In summary, they need to add <m>21</m> pounds of the Honduran coffee beans to <m>9</m> pounds of the Columbian coffee beans to create this blend. Our estimate in <xref ref="example-estimating-mixing-coffee">example</xref> was pretty close, so we know our answer is reasonable.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>Throughout your algebra course and beyond, you will encounter algebra simplification situations that we are about to discuss. Algebra simplification is a skill<mdash/>like cooking noodles or painting a wall. It's not always exciting, but it does serve a purpose. Also like cooking noodles or painting a wall, it's not usually difficult. And yet there are common avoidable mistakes that people make. With practice from this section, you'll have experience to prevent yourself from overcooking the noodles or ruining your paintbrush.</p>

        <title>Something Nontrivial as Input</title>

        <p>Let's start by reminding ourselves about the meaning of function notation. When we write <m>f(x)</m>, we have a process <m>f</m> that is doing something to an input value <m>x</m>. Whatever is inside those parentheses is the input to the function. What if we use something for input that is not quite as simple as <q><m>x</m></q>?</p>

        <example xml:id="example-f-of-minus-x">
            <statement>
                <p>If <m>f(x)=x^2+3x-4</m>, find and simplify a formula for <m>f(-x)</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>Those parentheses encase <q><m>-x</m></q>, so we are meant to treat <q><m>-x</m></q> as the input. The rule that we have been given for <m>f</m> is <me>f(x)=x^2+3x-4</me>. But the <m>x</m>'s that are in this formula are just place-holders. What <m>f</m> does to a number can just as easily be communicated with<me>f(\phantom{x})=(\phantom{x})^2+3(\phantom{x})-4</me>. So now that we are meant to treat <q><m>-x</m></q> as the input, we will insert <q><m>-x</m></q> into those slots, after which we can do more familiar algebraic simplification:<md>
                    <mrow>f(\phantom{x})\amp=(\phantom{x})^2+3(\phantom{x})-4</mrow>
                    <mrow>f(\substitute{-x})\amp=(\substitute{-x})^2+3(\substitute{-x})-4</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=x^2-3x-4</mrow>
                </md></p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>The previous example constrasts nicely with this one:</p>

        <example xml:id="example-minus-f-of-x">
            <statement>
                <p>If <m>f(x)=x^2+3x-4</m>, find and simplify a formula for <m>-f(x)</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>Here, the parentheses only encase <q><m>x</m></q>. The negative sign is on the outside. So the way to see this expression is that first <m>f</m> will do what it does to <m>x</m>, and then that result will be negated:<md>
                    <mrow>-f(x)\amp=-(\substitute{x^2+3x-4})</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=-x^2-3x+4</mrow>
                </md></p>
                <p>Note that the answer to this exercise, which was to simplify <m>-f(x)</m>, is different from the answer to <xref ref="example-f-of-minus-x">Exercise</xref>, which was to simplify <m>f(-x)</m>. In general you cannot pass a negative sign in and out of function notation and still have the same quantity.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>If <m>f(x)=2x^2+8</m>, find and simplify a formula for <m>f(3x)</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>Those parentheses encase <q><m>3x</m></q>, so we are meant to treat <q><m>3x</m></q> as the input.<md>
                    <mrow>f(\phantom{x})\amp=2(\phantom{x})^2++8</mrow>
                    <mrow>f(\substitute{3x})\amp=2(\substitute{3x})^2+8</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=2\left(9x^2\right)+8</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=18x^2+8</mrow>
                </md></p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <example xml:id="example-f-of-x-minus-four">
            <statement>
                <p>If <m>f(x)=x^2-3x</m>, find and simplify a formula for <m>f(x-4)</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>This kind of example is often challenging for algebra students. But let's focus on those parentheses one more time. They encase <q><m>x-4</m></q>, so we are meant to treat <q><m>x-4</m></q> as the input.<md>
                    <mrow>f(\phantom{x})\amp=(\phantom{x})^2-3(\phantom{x})</mrow>
                    <mrow>f(\substitute{x-4})\amp=(\substitute{x-4})^2-3(\substitute{x-4})</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=x^2-8x+16-3x+12</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=x^2- 11x+28</mrow>
                </md></p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>The tasks that are shown in <xref first="example-f-of-minus-x" last="example-f-of-x-minus-four">Exercises</xref> are the kind of task that will make it easier to understand interesting and useful material in college algebra and calculus.</p>

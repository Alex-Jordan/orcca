        <p>This book has been made possible through Portland Community College's Strategic Investment Funding, approved by PCC's Budget Planning Advisory Council and the Board of Directors. Without significant funding to provide the authors with the adequate time, an ambitious project such as this one would not be possible.</p>

        <p>The technology that makes it possible to create synced print, eBook, and <webwork /> content is <pretext />, created by Rob Beezer. David Farmer and the American Institute of Mathematics have worked to make the <pretext /> eBook layout functional, yet simple. A grant from OpenOregon funded the original bridge between <webwork /> and <pretext />.</p>

        <p>This book uses <webwork /> to provide most of its exercises, which may be used for online homework. <webwork /> was created by Mike Gage and Arnie Pizer, and has benefited from over <m>25</m> years of contributions from open source developers. In 2013, Chris Hughes, Alex Jordan, and Carl Yao programmed most of the <webwork/> questions in this book with a PCC curriculum development grant.</p>

        <p>The javascript library MathJax, created and maintained by David Cervone, Volker Sorge, Christian Lawson-Perfect, and Peter Krautzberger allows math content to render nicely on screen in the eBook. Additionally, MathJax makes web accessible mathematics possible.</p>

        <p>The print edition (<init>PDF</init>) is built using the typesetting software <latex />, created by Donald Knuth and enhanced by Leslie Lamport.</p>

        <p>Each of these open technologies, along with many that we use but have not listed here, has been enhanced by many additional contributors spanning the past 40 years. We are grateful for all of these contributions.</p>

            <title><init>HTML</init> and <init>PDF</init></title>
            <p>This book is available as an eBook, a free PDF, or printed and bound. All versions offer the same content and are synchronized such that cross-references match across versions. They can each be found at <url href="https://spaces.pcc.edu/display/MS/Precollege+Algebra+OER">spaces.pcc.edu/display/MS/Precollege+Algebra+OER</url>.</p>
            <p>The list below describes the distinctions in the eBook, PDF, and printed versions.<ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The eBook is recommended, as it offers interactive elements and easier navigation than print.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A <init>PDF</init> version can be downloaded and then accessed without the internet. Some content is in color, but most of the colorized content from the eBook has been converted to black and white to ensure adequate contrast when printing. The exceptions are the graphs generated by <webwork />.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Printed and bound copies are available online. Up-to-date information about purchasing a copy should be available at <url href="https://spaces.pcc.edu/display/MS/Precollege+Algebra+OER">spaces.pcc.edu/display/MS/Precollege+Algebra+OER</url>. Contact the authors if you have trouble finding the latest version online. For each online sale, all royalties go to a PCC Foundation account, where roughly half will fund student scholarships, and half will fund continued maintenance of this book and other OER.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The answers to the odd homework exercises at the end of each section are not contained in the eBook, <init>PDF</init>, or print versions, but are available at <url href="https://spaces.pcc.edu/display/MS/Precollege+Algebra+OER">spaces.pcc.edu/display/MS/Precollege+Algebra+OER</url>.</p>

            <title>Copying Content</title>
            <p>The graphs and other images that appear in this manual may be copied in various file formats using the eBook version. Below each image are links to <c>.png</c>, <c>.eps</c>, <c>.svg</c>, <c>.pdf</c>, and <c>.tex</c> files that contain the image.</p> 

            <p>Mathematical content can be copied from the eBook. To copy math content into <pubtitle>MS Word</pubtitle>, right-click or control-click over the math content, and click to <c>Show Math As MathML Code</c>. Copy the resulting code, and <c>Paste Special</c> into <pubtitle>Word</pubtitle>. In the <c>Paste Special</c> menu, paste it as <c>Unformatted Text</c>. To copy math content into <latex/> source, right-click or control-click over the math content, and click to <c>Show Math As TeX Commands</c>.</p>

            <p>Tables can be copied from the eBook version and pasted into applications like <pubtitle>MS Word</pubtitle>. However, mathematical content within tables will not always paste correctly without a little extra effort as described above.</p>

            <title>Accessibility</title>
            <p>The <init>HTML</init> version is intended to meet or exceed web accessibility standards. If you encounter an accessibility issue, please report it to the editor.<ul>
                <li>
                    <p>All graphs and images will eventually have meaningful alt text that communicates what a sighted person would see, without necessarily giving away anything that is intended to be deduced from the image. Construction of alt text is underway, and will be complete by Summer 2018.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>All math content is rendered using MathJax. MathJax has a contextual menu that can be accessed in several ways, depending on what operating system and browser you are using. The most common way is to right-click or control-click on some piece of math content.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>In the MathJax contextual menu, you may set options for triggering a zoom effect on math content, and also by what factor the zoom will be.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If you change the MathJax renderer to MathML, then a screen reader will generally have success verbalizing the math content.</p>

        <paragraphs>
            <title>Tablets and Smartphones</title>
            <p><pretext /> documents like this book are <q>mobile-friendly</q>. When you view the <init>HTML</init> version, the display adapts to whatever screen size or window size you are using. A math teacher will always recommend that you do not study from the small screen on a phone, but if it's necessary, the eBook gives you that option.</p>

        <title>Pedagogical Decisions</title>

        <p>The authors have taken various stances on certain pedagogical and notational questions that arise in basic algebra instruction. We attempt to catalog these decisions here, although this list will certainly be incomplete. If you find something in the book that runs contrary to these decisions, please let us know.</p>

        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p>Interleaving is our preferred approach, compared to a proficiency-based approach. To us, this means that once the book covers a topic, that topic will be appear in subsequent sections and chapters in indirect ways.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><xref ref="chapter-basic-math-review">Chapter</xref> is written as a <em>review</em>, and is not intended to teach these topics from first principles.</p>
            </li>
<!--                <li>
                    <p>The <m>y</m>-intercept is a single number, not an ordered pair whose first coordinate is <m>0</m>. The notion of a <m>y</m>-intercept makes sense in higher dimensions than two, so why specify <m>(0,b)</m>? It's also implied in the name, <m>y</m>-intercept, that this place is on the <m>y</m>-axis. So <m>x</m> (and <m>z</m>, <m>w</m>, <etc />) are implied to be <m>0</m>, and there is no need to repeat that in an ordered tuple.</p>

                    <p>We feel similarly for an <m>x</m>-intercept. We acknowledge one downside to this position. And that is the unfortunate situation of a student who calculates an <m>x</m>-intercept of say <m>2</m> and a <m>y</m>-intercept of say <m>3</m> and comes to think that their line passes through <m>(2,3)</m>.</p>
                </li>--><!--Approved by: Alex-->
            <li>
                <p>We round decimal results to four significant digits, or possibly fewer leaving out trailing zeros. We do this to maintain consistency with the most common level of precision that <webwork /> uses to assess decimal answers. We <em>round</em>, not <em>truncate</em>. And we use the <m>\approx</m> symbol. For example <m>\pi\approx3.142</m> and Portland's population is <m>\approx609500</m>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>We intend to offer <em>alternative</em> video lessons associated with each section. These are intended to provide readers with an alternative to whatever we have written on a topic. We have produced videos for <xref first="chapter-basic-math-review" last="chapter-graphing-lines">Chapters</xref>. In later chapters we sometimes use videos from YouTube, but intend to produce videos at some point in the future. The YouTube videos more than likely do not cover 100<percent /> of what our written content covers. And such videos may use notation and approaches that differ from ours.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Traditionally, a math textbook has examples throughout each section. This textbook uses two types of example:</p>
                <p><dl width="narrow">
                    <li>
                        <title>Static</title>
                        <p>These are labeled <q>Example.</q> Static examples may or may not be subdivided into a <q>statement</q> followed by a walk-through solution. This is basically what traditional examples from math textbooks do.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Active</title>
                        <p>These are labeled <q>Exercise,</q> not to be confused with the exercises that come at the end of a section that might be assigned for homework, etc. In the <init>HTML</init> output, active examples have <webwork /> answer blanks where a reader could try submitting an answer. In the <init>PDF</init> output, active examples are almost indistinguishable from static examples. Generally, a walk-through solution is provided immediately following the answer blank.</p>
                        <p>Some <init>HTML</init> readers will skip the opportunity to try an active example and go straight to its solution. Some readers will try an active example once and then move on to the solution. Some readers will tough it out for a period of time and resist reading the solution.</p>
                        <p>For readers of the <init>PDF</init>, it is expected that they would read the example and its solution just as they would read a static example.</p>
                        <p>It is important to understand that a reader is <em>not</em> required to try submitting an answer to an active example before moving on. It is also important to understand that a reader <em>is</em> expected to read the solution to an active example, even if they succeed on their own at finding an answer.</p>
                    </li>
                </dl></p>
                <p>Interspersed through a section there are usually several exercises that are intended as active reading exercises. A reader can work these examples and submit answers to <webwork /> to see if they are correct. The important thing is to keep the reader actively engaged instead of providing another static written example. In most cases, it is expected that a reader will read the solutions to these exercises just as they would be expected to read a more traditional static example.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>We believe in nearly always opening a topic with some level of application rather than abstract examples. From applications and practical questions, we move to motivate more abstract definitions and notation. This approach is perhaps absent in the first chapter, which is intended to be a review only. At first this may feel backwards to some instructors, with some <q>easier</q> examples (with no context) coming later than some of the contextual examples.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Linear inequalities are not strictly separated from linear equations. The same section that teaches how to solve <m>2x+3=8</m> will also teach how to solve <m>2x+3\lt8</m>. There will be sufficient subdivisions within sections so that an instructor may focus on equations only or inequalities only if they so choose.</p>

                <p>Our aim is to not treat inequalities as an add-on optional topic, but rather to show how intimately related they are to corresponding equations.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When issues of <q>proper formatting</q> of student work arise, we value that the reader understand <em>why</em> such things help the reader to communicate outwardly. We believe that mathematics is about more than understanding a topic, but also about understanding it well enough to communicate results to others.</p>

                <p>For example we promote progression of equations like<md>
                    <mrow>1+1+1\amp=2+1</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=3</mrow>
                </md>instead of <me>1+1+1=2+1=3\text{.}</me>And we want students to <em>understand</em> that the former method makes their work easier for a reader to read. It is not simply a matter of <q>this is the standard and this is how it's done.</q></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When solving equations (or systems), most examples should come with a check, intended to communicate to students that checking is part of the process. In <xref first="chapter-basic-math-review" last="chapter-graphing-lines">Chapters</xref>, these checks will be complete simplifications using order of operations one step at a time. The later sections will often have more summary checks where either order of operations steps are skipped in groups, or we promote entering expressions into a calculator. Occasionally in later sections the checks will still have finer details, especially when there are issues like with negative numbers squared.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Within a section, any first example of solving some equation (or system) should summarize with some variant of both <q>the solution is<ellipsis /></q> and <q>the solution set is<ellipsis /></q>. Later examples can mix it up, but always offer at least one of these.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>There is a section on very basic arithmetic (five operations on natural numbers) in an appendix, not in the first chapter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>With applications of linear equations (as opposed to linear systems), we limit applications to situations where the setup will be in the form <m>x + f(x) = C</m> and also certain rate problems where the setup will be in the form <m>5t + 4t = C</m>. There are other classes of application problem (mixing problems, interest problems, <ellipsis />) which can be handled with a system of two equations, and we reserve these until linear systems are covered.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>With simplifications of rational expressions, we always include domain restrictions that are lost in the simplification. For example, we would write <m>\frac{x(x+1)}{x+1}=x</m>, for <m>x\neq-1</m>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
